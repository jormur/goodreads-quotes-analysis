# Analyzing Viral Content on Goodreads: A Data Science Approach to Understanding Quote Popularity

This project applies advanced data science techniques to analyze what makes quotes go viral on Goodreads, combining traditional econometric methods with cutting-edge natural language processing. Using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekvermasg1/goodreads-quotes) of popular quotes from the platform, I investigated how content characteristics, emotional sentiment, and author influence affect engagement.

The analysis employs multiple methodological approaches:

- Natural Language Processing (BERT) for sentiment analysis
- Network analysis to map author relationships and influence
- Machine learning for popularity prediction
- Statistical analysis of quote characteristics

Key findings revealed that viral success isn't simply about positive messagingâ€”quotes with complex emotional content often perform well, despite positive quotes averaging 1,744 likes compared to 939 for negative ones. Surface-level features like length and complexity showed surprisingly weak correlations with popularity. The project identified 8 distinct author communities through network analysis.

Interestingly, the challenge in predicting quote popularity (demonstrated by a negative R-squared score) suggests that virality depends on complex factors beyond textual characteristics alone, including timing and network effects.

This project showcases the application of both Python and R in data science, demonstrating proficiency in:

- Advanced NLP techniques
- Network analysis
- Statistical modeling
- Data visualization
- Machine learning
- Causal inference
